    <h1>Standast</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Standast is a ringed frontier city with a high iron wall exterior to defend against the dangerous forests surrounding it. The rings formed as the city grew and expanded from "first landing" with "The Eye" at the center of the city, and each subsequent
        ring bordered by iron walls that once served as the exterior. The eye consists of towering buildings encircling a massive courtyard that contains a secret teleportation circle. </p>
    <h2>Slums</h2>
    <p>The city has grown large enough to support an underground market with its own economy. Depraved residents or those less fortunate can be found here, as well as the best places to find cheap drinks and for those in the know, the best information. Thieves
        guild secretly distributes wealth given to them on purpose by clandestine sect of The Brave led by Captain Bondal to keep the city economy moving </p>
    <h2>Manufacturing District</h2>
    <p>If it gets made it gets made here. Shut down at sundown in an effort to not attract the nightmares that roam the forest. Home of the Smith Guild </p>
    <h2>Farming District</h2>
    <p>All of the food and sustenance that is not provided by the forest is grown here. Farmers doctor the land led by an old gnome named <a href="npc/sprout-ing.html">Sprout Ing</a> who lived on the old world as a botanist and has invaluable knowledge in
        regards to growing, likely the only reason the city still exists today. </p>
