    <p>Trees shove roots deep into the ground, coiling through the dense soil so their trunks might grow higher, the better to drink from the sun. Those unable to keep up shed their leaves to compost amongst the seething masses of the jungle floors. Barren
        wood towers once home to canopy dwellers rotting and crumbling. The teeming insects make quick work of the deadwood, now rich dirt full of nutrients to start the process anew. In this way the backbone , pulled thirstily from the sun, spawns the
        many limbs of the Tree of life

    <p>Today is the proving. You will take your assigned role in <a href='city/standast.html'>Standast</a>, your duty to the sole city on Taldren.
